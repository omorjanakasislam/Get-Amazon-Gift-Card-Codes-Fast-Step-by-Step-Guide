Shop through the app and complete your purchases as usual.
Accumulate cashback or points and redeem them for Amazon gift cards once you've reached the minimum payout threshold.
3. Participate in Paid Surveys
Paid survey sites allow you to share your opinions on various products and services in exchange for rewards. Popular platforms such as Swagbucks, InboxDollars, and MyPoints offer Amazon gift cards as a redemption option for completing surveys, watching videos, or playing games.

Steps to Follow:
Sign up for a survey website like Swagbucks or InboxDollars.
Complete your profile and start receiving surveys.

Sign up for product testing programs and create your profile.
Once accepted into campaigns, you’ll receive free products to try.
Complete reviews or share your feedback online.

Use shopping portals like Swagbucks or Shopkick before making purchases on Amazon or partner retailers.
Alternatively, earn points through in-store scanning (e.g., Shopkick app).
Accumulate points that can be redeemed for Amazon gift cards.
6. Join Amazon's Mechanical Turk Program (MTurk)

Keep an eye on Amazon's website for current promotions and contests.
Participate in sweepstakes, Prime Day deals, or other special offers.
If you're lucky, you might win a free Amazon gift card.
8. Refer Friends to Amazon
Amazon’s referral program allows you to earn rewards when you refer friends to join Amazon or sign up for Amazon Prime. While this typically rewards users with a credit towards their next purchase, it’s often possible to earn a gift card.

Go to the Amazon referral page or use the referral link in your account.
Share your referral link with friends or family to encourage them to sign up for Amazon Prime or make their first purchase.
